# tm

An opinionated manager for `tmux` sessions. Use `tm` for managing groups of
`tmux` sessions.

A `tmux` session might contain a combination of multiple windows and/or multiple
splits (panes). With a project containing one or more sessions.

Some inspiration was taken from [smug](https://github.com/ivaaaan/smug), however
it lacked the ability start multiple sessions, which is part of my personal
workflow.
